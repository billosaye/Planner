# TODO App

## Overview
The TODO App is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to help users manage tasks through a web interface. It provides basic CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, with a React frontend and an Express backend connected to MongoDB Atlas. This project is developed over a 3-week timeline, with Week 1 focusing on setup and backend development. This README documents the completed backend phase, including project setup, database integration, RESTful API implementation, and finalization for frontend integration and deployment.

### Project Goals
- Build a simple TODO App allowing users to create, view, update, and delete tasks.
- Implement a RESTful API for task management using Express and MongoDB.
- Prepare the backend for frontend integration and deployment on Vercel.
- Use a Git workflow with `main` (stable) and `dev` (in-progress) branches.

### Current Status
- **Week 1 (Setup and Backend Development)** is complete:
  - Day 1: Project setup (frontend and backend initialization, Git workflow).
  - Day 2: Database setup (MongoDB Atlas, Task schema, connection).
  - Day 3: Backend API development (RESTful API for CRUD operations, manual testing).
  - Day 5: Backend finalization (CORS, environment variables, Vercel deployment preparation).
- **Day 4 (Backend Validation and Testing)** was skipped, so the API has minimal validation (e.g., required `title` field). This may require client-side validation in the frontend or future enhancements.
- The backend is fully functional and ready for frontend integration in Week 2.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend (Initialized on Day 1)
- **React** with **TypeScript**: Frontend framework and type safety.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **TanStack Router**: Client-side routing (to be integrated in Week 2).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**: Backend framework (JavaScript, not TypeScript).
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-hosted MongoDB database.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

### Tools
- **pnpm**: Package manager for both frontend and backend.
- **Git**: Version control with GitHub (`main` and `dev` branches).
- **nodemon**: Live reloading for backend development.
- **Postman/curl**: Manual API testing.

## Project Structure
The project uses a monorepo structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend:

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
- **pnpm**: Install globally with `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **MongoDB Atlas Account**: For database hosting (set up on Day 2).
- **Postman or curl**: For manual API testing.

### Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd todo-app
Switch to the dev branch (where development occurs):
bash
git checkout dev
Backend Setup (todo-app-backend)
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
cd todo-app-backend
Install dependencies:
bash
pnpm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file based on .env.example:
bash
cp .env.example .env
Edit .env with your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.<unique>.mongodb.net/todoapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace <username>, <password>, and <unique> with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.
Start the backend development server:
bash
pnpm dev
The server runs on http://localhost:3000.
Expected output: MongoDB connected successfully and Server running on port 3000.
Frontend Setup (todo-app-frontend)
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
cd ../todo-app-frontend
Install dependencies:
bash
pnpm install
Start the frontend development server:
bash
pnpm dev
The frontend runs on http://localhost:5173.
Note: The frontend is currently a basic Vite template (Week 2 will add components and API integration).
Backend API
The backend provides a RESTful API for task management, accessible at http://localhost:3000/api. The API supports CRUD operations for tasks.

Notes on Validation
Minimal validation exists: title is required for creating tasks.
Day 4 (skipped) would have added robust validation (e.g., string length, type checks). You may need client-side validation in the frontend to handle edge cases (e.g., empty titles, large inputs).
Development Process (Week 1: Setup and Backend Development)
Day 1: Project Setup
Objective: Initialize the project structure, set up Git, and configure the frontend and backend.
Key Concepts:
Monorepo structure (todo-app with todo-app-frontend and todo-app-backend).
Git workflow: main (stable), dev (in-progress).
Frontend: Vite, React, TypeScript, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Express, JavaScript, pnpm, nodemon, .env.
Steps:
Initialized Git repository, set up branches, and pushed to GitHub.
Created frontend with Vite (pnpm create vite todo-app-frontend --template react-ts).
Installed frontend dependencies (TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS).
Created backend with Express, installed dependencies (express, mongoose, dotenv, nodemon).
Set up basic Express server (src/index.js) and tested both servers.
Committed to dev branch.
Day 2: Database Setup
Objective: Set up MongoDB Atlas, define the Task schema, and connect the backend to the database.
Key Concepts:
MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted data storage.
Mongoose for schema definition and database operations.
Task schema: title, description, completed, timestamps.
Modular database connection using environment variables.
Steps:
Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster, created database user, and added connection string to .env.
Defined Task schema (src/models/Task.js).
Created database connection module (src/utils/db.js).
Updated src/index.js to connect to MongoDB before starting the server.
Tested connection and committed changes to dev.
Day 3: Backend API Development
Objective: Implement a RESTful API for task CRUD operations, create controllers/routes, add error handling, and test endpoints.
Key Concepts:
RESTful API design for CRUD operations.
Modular controllers and routes for maintainability.
Global error handling middleware.
Manual testing with curl/Postman.
Steps:
Created controllers (src/controllers/taskController.js) for CRUD operations.
Defined routes (src/routes/taskRoutes.js) using Express Router.
Added error handling middleware (src/middleware/errorHandler.js).
Updated src/index.js to use routes and error handler.
Manually tested all endpoints (success and error cases) with curl.
Committed changes to dev.
Day 5: Backend Finalization
Objective: Add CORS, finalize environment variables, prepare for Vercel deployment, and retest the API.
Key Concepts:
CORS to enable frontend requests from a different origin.
Environment variable configuration for development and production.
Vercel deployment preparation (serverless environment).
Retesting to ensure functionality.
Steps:
Installed and configured CORS (pnpm add cors, added app.use(cors()) in src/index.js).
Reviewed .env, created .env.example for deployment reference.
Prepared for Vercel deployment (vercel.json, verified package.json scripts).
Retested API endpoints and CORS functionality.
Committed changes to dev.
Deployment Preparation
The backend is configured for deployment on Vercel (serverless environment):
vercel.json: Defines build and routing rules.
package.json: Includes start script (node src/index.js) and main field.
Environment Variables: Must be set in Vercel’s dashboard (use .env.example as a guide).
Deployment Steps (To Be Completed in Week 3)
Deploy todo-app-backend to Vercel via the Vercel CLI or dashboard.
Set environment variables (MONGODB_URI) in Vercel.
Deploy the frontend and configure it to use the backend’s deployed URL.
Known Limitations
Validation: Due to skipping Day 4, the API has minimal validation (only title is required). Edge cases (e.g., empty titles, large inputs) may need client-side validation in the frontend.
Frontend: Currently a basic Vite template (Week 2 will add components and API integration).
Authentication: Not included in the MVP (future enhancement).
Next Steps
Week 2: Frontend Development (Days 6-10):
Build React components for task management.
Add routing with TanStack Router.
Connect to the backend API.
Style the app with Tailwind CSS.
Test frontend-backend integration.
Week 3: Testing and Deployment (Days 11-15):
Test the full app.
Optimize and polish the UI/UX.
Deploy to Vercel.
